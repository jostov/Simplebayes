This is a simple form of naive bayes built for the purpose of learning about naive bayes.
There are vastly superior implementations, and one that I particularly recommend is the one
available in the Scikit learn package, as it has a number of improvements, including recursive
average calculation, which cuts down runtime and memory usage dramatically.
